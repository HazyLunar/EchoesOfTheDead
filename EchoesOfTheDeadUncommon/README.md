# Echoes of the Dead Mod for Project Zomboid

Engulf yourself in the harrowing world of Project Zomboid with the `Echoes of the Dead` mod. Every fallen zombie might have a haunting final cry, sending shivers down the spines of survivors.

## Features

- **Chilling Zombie Sounds:** The mod includes an array of distinct screams, ensuring that players never quite know what to expect upon each zombie kill.
- **Dynamic Screams:** Not all zombies will scream upon death. There's a chance that a killed zombie might let out a chilling scream, adding a layer of unpredictability.
- **Varied Loudness & Distance:** The intensity (ranging from 50 to 110) and the distance (from 70 to 250 tiles) of the screams are randomized, making every scream unique in its own way.
- **Sandbox Settings:** Now with a new version, adding in Sandbox Settings that work both in Multiplayer and Singleplayer. Players can now customize screams % chance to their liking!
- **Player-Centric Design:** The scream plays around the player's location, giving a more immersive experience.
