               Echoes of the Dead Mod for Project Zomboid - Main Logic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Author: Stormbox
    Description: An active contributor and modder for Project Zomboid.

    Purpose: The "Echoes of the Dead" mod amplifies the eeriness of Project Zomboid by
             playing randomized, haunting zombie screams whenever a zombie is killed.
             The chilling echoes serve as a stark reminder of the apocalyptic setting,
             enhancing the game's atmosphere and immersion.
